To use this extension:
1. Download the code as a ZIP and extract the folder to a place on your computer (somewhere you will remember where it is).
2. Enable developer mode in chrome://extensions (or opera://extensions). 
3. On the extensions page click the button at the top of the page that says "Load unpacked" and select the extracted folder. 
4. Enjoy!

Coming soon:
- Select fields that can be filtered by text (faster access to language instead of scrolling through every option).
- Ability to download extension from extension store.
- Ability for in-text translation instead of a new tab opening to google translate.
